            <h1>Mr Fowler</h1>
            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            Mr Fowler is an okay chef (for a high school computing teacher).
            He pretty much learned how to cook from his mum.
            he creates healthy dishes which promote good nutrition and long life
            -useful for him as he is quite old! Some of these recipes are actually his 
            - usually just some hot-shot's recipe with a few expensive ingredients changed 
            to cheaper alternatives - cooking for yourself is actually a great way to save money.
